# Connectors

Connectors define how to access a computer (file and process management). There are two types at the moment in experimaestro:

- {py:class}`~experimaestro.connectors.local.LocalConnector` - Connector for executing tasks on the local machine (default).
- {py:class}`~experimaestro.connectors.ssh.SshConnector` - Connector for remote execution via SSH (alpha).
